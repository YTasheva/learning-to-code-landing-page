## My process

### Build with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

- It is best to build HTML with semantic elements to increase readability and provide a good reading experience.
- Image elements need to have accessible alt attributes, and image elements do not need a closing tag.
- Add the id attribute to the heading that needs to be navigated.
- A unique title is required.
- The heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- Use class to reduce or merge duplicates in CSS.

To see how I add code snippets, see below:

```html
<title>Learning to code landing page</title>
<header><nav>...</nav></header>
<h1>Hori<span>seo</span>n</h1>
<h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
<section id="search-engine-optimization">...</section>
```
```css
.benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost {
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```
